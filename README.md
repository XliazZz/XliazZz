I'm a software developer who is passionate about creating technology to elevate people and helping new developers find the right path. Some technologies I enjoy working with include Javascript, ReactJS, React-Native, and Redux.

ðŸ”­ I'm a developer in Buenos Aires, Argentina.
ðŸŒ± I studied at Henry's bootcamp as a web developer full-stack.
âš¡ Fun fact: I'm 20 years old!

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about **JavaScript, ReactJs, Redux, NodeJs, and Postgres SQL**.
